Since ICAM programs involve the collecting, storing, sharing, and maintenance of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), federal agencies must implement solutions that actively support privacy protections and the widely-recognized FIPPs. Under the Privacy Act, which is based on FIPPs, agencies are required to have certain processes and procedures governing their use of PII in oplace. Agencies should first assess those processes and procedures and determine whether the implementation of an ICAM program constitutes a new use of PII that requires adjustment of existing processes and procedures.

The following list provides a description of each of the FIPPs and discusses practical implementation considerations for applying them within an ICAM program.

### Fair Information Practice Principles
<div id="accordion" markdown="1">

### Individual Participation
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should involve the individual in the process of using PII. To the extent practicable, agencies should seek individual consent for the collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance of PII. Organizations should also provide mechanisms for appropriate access, correction, and redress regarding use of PII.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

Agencies that currently interact with the public in a face-to-face context and/or engage in paper/telephone transactions must recognize that there will continue to be people who will not feel comfortable adopting technological processes. They should continue to offer physical alternatives for processes that are not inherently technology-based.

Agencies should also provide redress mechanisms in accordance with the Privacy Act that allow people to report and correct information that is inaccurate, lost, or compromised and damages resulting from incorrect authentication or unauthorized access.
Redress mechanisms help enhance confidence in the program and promote individual participation.

### Transparency
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should be transparent with respect to the information they collect and share, and provide notice to the individual regarding collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance of PII.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

A foundational principle in federal privacy law is that people have the right to know what information the government collects and retains about them and, to a great extent, the right to control how that information is being used. When building ICAM programs, agencies should consider this principle and ensure the following prior to each occurrence of information collection and/or transmission:

*  The user is clearly informed what information elements will be collected
*  The user understands who will receive the information
*  The user is clearly informed of how the information will be used
*  The user must affirmatively choose to participate before any information is transmitted

</div>

### Data Minimization
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should only collect PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose(s) and only retain PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the specified purpose(s).

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

Agencies should only collect the information necessary to carry out ICAM business functions. Wherever possible, agencies should use assertions of an individual’s identity in lieu of identifying data elements. For example, if an application has an age limitation, the program should ask for proof of age rather than the exact birth date. Agencies should also determine how long specific categories of information associated with ICAM processes will be retained and implement procedures for destruction of the information at the end of the retention period.

</div>

### Use Limitation
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should use PII solely for the purpose(s) specified in the notice. Sharing PII should be for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

The Privacy Act generally requires that once an individual consents to the collection of his information for a specific, stated purpose, that information can only be used for that purpose. This is particularly important to remember when considering the sharing of information between programs. If the programs have different purposes, such sharing will likely not be permissible without additional consent from the user. Agencies should carefully consider this limitation when crafting their privacy notices for ICAM programs.

</div>

### Security
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should protect PII (in all media) through appropriate security safeguards against risks such as loss, unauthorized access or use, destruction, modification, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

Agencies must ensure the security of information at all stages (collection, transmission, storage, destruction) in accordance with various legal and policy requirements (e.g., FISMA and OMB M-07-16).87 Examples of techniques for securing data are: 

*  Encryption
*  Strong authentication procedures
*  Time out functionality
*  Minimum security controls to make information unusable by unauthorized individuals.

</div>

### Data Quality & Integrity
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should, to the extent practicable, ensure that PII is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

Agencies should identify and implement means to ensure that PII is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete, including providing mechanisms for individuals to correct inaccuracies in their information.

</div>

### Accountability & Auditing
<div markdown="1">
### Description

Agencies should be accountable for complying with these principles, providing training to all employees and contractors who use PII. Agencies are also responsible for auditing the actual use of PII to demonstrate compliance with these principles and all applicable privacy protection requirements.

### ICAM Implementation Considerations

ICAM implementers should establish accountability measures to ensure that each of the FIPPs is appropriately applied and effectively protect users’ privacy. Such measures can include ICAM program audits and reviews by agency privacy and security officials. Agencies should address accountability for specific requirements, such as the M-07-16 requirement for annual certification of training for employees who handle PII. Clear accountability will promote confidence in ICAM programs.
